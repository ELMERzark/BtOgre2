#BtOgre21 - Simple Bullet-Ogre 2.1 connection


BtOgre21 is a simple Bullet-Ogre connection made for Ogre 2.1+

This is a forked project from BtOgre, originally created by nikki93 (as of his github name), and take root form a fork by nyxkn.

The goal is to reorganise the source code of this project, and also do some cleaning.

In the present state, it is relying on Ogre v1 mesh object to generate Bullet body shapes. I want to move that to be fully Ogre v2.

the CMake build on this repo, and the premake / lua things are probably broken as of now, and this project is pretty much a work in progress.

One of the things I will do is make CMake output a project that build BtOgre as either a static or dynamic library properly. I'm currently using BtOgre with the "paste the sources in your project" and that's not that great... ^^"
